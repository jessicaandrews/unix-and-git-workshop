### Testing Out of the Workshop

To test out of the workshop, you will need to complete this assignment. Completion of this assignment, whether independently or at the workshop, is due before the start of your Code Fellows course.

Demonstrate the following skills using **only** your Terminal, your text editor, and your web browser.

##### 1. Create a fork of this repository

##### 2. Clone the fork to your computer

##### 3. Create a new branch called `notes`

##### 4. Checkout the branch `notes`

##### 5. Create a directory with the same name as your GitHub username

For example, `codefellows`

##### 6. Create a `unix_notes.txt` file in this directory

For example, `codefellows/unix_notes.txt`

##### 7. Add the notes about what you've learned about Unix to this file

For example,

```
cd <path> Changes the working directory to <path>
ls <path> Lists the directory content of <path>
...
```

##### 8. Create a `git_notes.txt` file in this directory

For example, `codefellows/git_notes.txt`

##### 9. Add the notes about what you've learned about Git to this file

For example,

```
git add <file> Adds any changes inside <file> to the staging area
git commit -m '<message>' Commits the staging area to the repository with a <message>
...
```

##### 10. Add these untracked files to the staging area

##### 11. Commit the changes

##### 12. Push the branch to the `origin` remote on GitHub

##### 13. Send a pull request from this branch to Code Fellows' `master` branch

Survey Questions
What parts of the workshop today were awesome for your learning?
Setting up our computers in class helped a lot. In general working along on our computers was extremely helpful.

What parts of today's workshop could be improved for next time?
Possibly more or stronger wifi connections?  Some parts toward the end seemed a little more rushed, or maybe could have been shown on the screen for a little bit longer (for example merging in the terminal and then how to leave that screen)

On a scale of 1 - 10 how likely are you to recommend this class to a friend?
Depends on the friend, but if they have an interest in learning this - 9/10.
